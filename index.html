                Comcast cares about open source software, and is an active member of the open source community. Not only do we build and run much of our technology on open source platforms, we also contribute actively to dozens of open source projects and strive to open source many of the technologies we develop internally. We collaborate with other companies and projects as members of open source foundations such as the Linux Foundation, OpenStack Foundation, Apache Foundation and many other organizations for collaboration. This allows us to share our own experience and to contribute to industry direction.
            </p>
            <p class="message-content">
                Without open source software, Comcast would not be able to bring you great experiences through X1, provide you with outstanding Internet service, or become the fastest-growing home security provider. We support and encourage open source culture, tools and collaboration inside the company to enable developers to be productive and effective. We are built on open source software, and we are committed as a company to giving back to the community and sharing our work with the world.

                <p class="project-description">
                    FreeFlow is a composition based approach to Android Layouts. As opposed to default Android Layouts, FreeFlow Layouts are swappable at runtime which allows views to their new states smoothly. The fundamental difference here is that FreeFlow prefers Composition over Inheritance which makes the system a lot more adaptable.
